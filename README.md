# Zonotopes
A few matlab demos to illustrate zonotopes and their connection to hyperplane arrangements.

These matlab demos give examples of small zonotopes and demonstrate some results on zonotopes for better theoretical comprehension.

Note that most of these figures are generated by brute force computation and/or by explicitely enumerating exponentially many points. These are not meant to be efficient means to enumerate zonotope vertices. All these demos are intended for illustration purposes and are not an efficient way to solve large problems involving zonotopes.

## 2D and 3D zontopes from generators

Just draw a zonotope based on a few vectors in 2D or 3D.

## Generating a random zonotope vertex

This illustrates how to generate a random vertex of a zonotope by generating a random vector.

## Illustrate the Dual of Zonotope Vertex enumeration

Enumerating zonotope vertices is equivalent to enumerating cells in a hyperplane arrangement. These demos show in both 2D and 3D how to begin with a zonotope (with specified generators, and show how to obtain the corresponding hyperplane arrangement.
